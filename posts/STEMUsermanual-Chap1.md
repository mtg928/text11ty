# 1	Introduction

Topfield Consultancy’s SAFETY TRANSPORT ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE (STEMS) Tool is an Integrated Software package for the Railway Industry which models Safety and Reliability Availability Maintainability (RAM) characteristics of engineered transport systems. The software is designed for Engineers to perform safety and reliability calculations.
This is a desktop-based software tool provides engineers and managers with cost effective design solution for performing safety and reliability engineering calculations. 
Users will be able to create new or modify their existing calculations to support their system designs.
This User guide documents version 1 of the STEM software and details how to setup and run the STEM software.

The STEM software uses the following third Party Libraries:
  * JGraph  - https://github.com/jgraph
  * JasperReports - https://www.jaspersoft.com/
  * JFreeChart -  https://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/

  ## 1.1	What does STEMS DO?

STEM software integrates 8 tools to suit the needs of the engineering project and save you time. Our following Software Apps will help you model safety and reliability calculations efficiently:
 * Calculator management module (CMM)
 * Event Tree Analysis (ETA) module
 * Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) module
 * Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)
 * Failure Mode Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA) 
 * Safety Integrity Level (SIL) module
 * Reliability Block diagram (RBD) module
 * Common cause failure (CCF) Module

Each calculator can be used separately or in various combinations.

  
## 1.2	Pre-requisites for the STEM software

The hardware and knowledge-based requirements for STEM software users are detailed below. 


The minimum requirements for using the STEM software.

System requirements
To operate the STEM software, you will need a dual core processor Windows machine with 4 gigabyte (GB) RAM, and an internet connection.
Further system details can be found in section 14.2.

Knowledge base requirements.


• Tip

To use the STEM, it is assumed that you have had experience in the use of safety and reliability tools or have successfully attended the STEM level 1 course. If not, it is recommended that you undertake the Introduction to STEM level 1 course as a minimum.
