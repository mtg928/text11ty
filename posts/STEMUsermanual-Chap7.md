## 7.2	FMEA summary tab
The FMEA Summary tab lists all the FMEA calculations. Users can track their FMEA calculations by calculation filename.




## 7.3	FMEA input summary operation

Users can add, edit, and remove project calculation details in the FMEA input calculator sheet. Users can also copy and paste data from one FMEA or from a text file. There is a refresh function to refresh the FMEA calculator data.  To access the menu list right click on the FMEA calculator sheet, which displays the dropdown menu.


## 7.3.1	Creating a new FMEA summary tab

STEM allows users to create a new FMEA template for developing models. A new FMEA template is created by selecting the ‘Add FMEA’ button in the FMEA summary input sheet, see Figure 21. Basic calculation information, including function name, calculation file, MPG type and template can be entered into the new FMEA options page as illustrated in the figure below.



## 7.3.2	Editing an FMEA summary 

To edit an FMEA record from the FMEA record in the row then click the Edit FMEA button in the menu bar, see Figure 19. A warning message will appear when you perform this operation. Select ‘Yes’ to perform operation or ‘No’ to stop the deletion, shown below.

## 7.3.3	Remove an FMEA record

To remove an FMEA record from the FMEA input sheet select the row in the FMEA and then click the Remove FMEA button in the menu bar, see Figure 19. A warning message will appear when you perform this operation. Select ‘Yes’ to perform operation or ‘No’ to stop the deletion, shown below.

! Note.

Warning: This operation will delete not only the record but also the functions and components associated with the FMEA. A warning message will appear when you perform this operation. The data deleted cannot be recovered!



## 7.3.4	View FMEA details

To view the FMEA sheet, click the View Details button on the right side of the summary sheet. This opens the FMEA calculator, which is in the FMEA calculator tab, where the user can build the FMEA models see Figure 20. 

The functions of the vertical button used to view the FMEA worksheet is shown in Table 6. 



FIGURE Here


• Tip 
The worksheet columns can be adjusted by dragging the edge of the cell.



## 7.4	FMEA calculator 

The FMEA calculator tab allows users to build the FMEA from the input sheet. The features of the FMEA worksheets are shown in the Figure 22. Two calculator templates are available to the user, the qualitative RPN method and quantitative versions of the FMEA.
Further details of the functions and components for both methods are described in s 7.6.1 and s7.6.2.

## 7.5	FMEA calculator operations 
[ ACTIONCHECK THE OPERATIONS AS PER THE LIST]

Users can Add, Edit, delete and save components in the FMEA Calculator. Users can also copy and paste data from one FMEA or from a text file. The Refresh function allows the user to refresh the FMEA data. Users can access the menu list by Right clicking on the FMEA calculator sheet.

## 7.5.1	Add a single row of data

To add a new component to the FMEA worksheet:
•	Select the cell or row on the FMEA worksheet and right click to open the menu list.  the component from the list of systems and main product group 
•	Select Add subcomponent from the list. An input panel will be displayed for the user to enter details, see Figure 24.
•	Click the radio button to select the specific component.
•	Click on the add button to include the selection to the FMEA input sheet.
The panel enables users to amend any row of data on the FMEA worksheet. The failure identification and failure effects which defined by the user are presented in Table 7. Table 8 describes detection measures.

If you require all subsystems in the analysis:
•	Click on the Select All button
•	Click on the add button.

## 7.5.2	Copy and paste data

Users can select the cell in the worksheet and click on it and hold down the left mouse button.  To obtain specific information on the Software, click on Edit, on the File menu bar and select Copy from the pull-down menu. Alternatively, select Ctrl – C on the keyboard to copy the object. 

Selected objects can be pasted within the worksheet by selecting Ctrl – P on the keyboard to paste the object.

## 7.5.3	Edit a single row of data

To edit a row on the FMEA worksheet:
•	Selected the cell or row on the FMEA worksheet and right click to open the menu list and select the edit selected row from the list of systems and main product group, see Figure 25.

You get a Popup to edit the information.  The following image show the FMEA add Popup based on the MIL standards.

The popup filled with previously entered information. You can edit the details and click save button to save the changes, see Figure 26.




FIGURE Here




Users can modify the data without using the “Edit Single Row” option by clicking the cell in the FMEA worksheet to edit the information directly.


• Tip 

Components information ("Id", "Subsystem Breakdown Code", "Subsystem/ Component" and "Failure mode") can only be modified in the FMEA summary tab section.

## 7.5.4	Save the FMEA file

FMEA data files may either be exported using the current case name or under a new name.

To save a file using the current file name, do one of the following:
•	Search the system from the list
•	Select Export report from the File menu, or
•	Use the key combination Ctrl + E.


To save a file using a new name, enter the following:
•	Select Export report from the File menu, or
•	Use the key combination Ctrl + E.

The dialog box with be displayed to save the file name as shown in Figure 28 for the FMEA file where the case file is saved for the first time or with a new name.

The user should clear the filename field, then type the new filename of the case and click the OK button. 


FIGURE Here

• Tip 
STEM software will automatically save the file extension, so Users do not need to enter it in the file dialog box.




## 7.5.5	Delete a component

To delete a component from the FMEA calculator:
•	Select the row containing the component in the FMEA calculator.
•	Click the Remove FMEA component button to delete the component from the FMEA calculator.
•	Click the Refresh button.

The component in the selected row will be removed in the current FMEA calculator.



FIGURE Here


! Note.

Warning: This operation will delete the row of data associated with the FMEA. A warning message will appear when you perform this operation. The data deleted cannot be recovered!



## 7.5.6	Delete a single row

The button allow user to delete a FMEA calculator row. You need select the row in in the table and click Delete Selected Row button to delete a record. 


• Tip 
The MPG and function cannot be deleted within the calculator sheet by this option. Users will need to delete the MPG and function options in the CMM or in the Calculation input sheet. 



## 7.5.7	Merge calculation data

The option will synchronise the FMEA data in the calculation file at the “local” App level with the data in the CMM. You can use this option to apply the changes to the FMEA. 



FIGURE Here - FMEA Calculation Worksheet – RPN method




## 7.6	Calculation Options

The two calculation templates are described this section.

## 7.6.1	Calculate RPN

The Risk Priority Number (RPN) is calculated by multiplying the severity of the effect of failure, the probability of occurrence, and the ability of detection for each failure mode.


• Note.

The RPN does not play an important part in the choice of an action against failure modes but will help in indicating the threshold values used to evaluate critical areas.
