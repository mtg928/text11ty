## 13	Calculation management module (CMM) 

The Calculation management module (CMM) is a central location for all the STEM calculations that is used for the project. The CMM file forms the master data file for project calculations. Users can define the scope, system, subsystem, functions and the components within the systems and subsystems for the project. The data defined is accessible to all calculator Apps.

To initiate the CMM App, click on the CMM icon on the left side menu bar.  A blank CMM input sheet will be displayed which is described in sections below.


## 13.1	CMM menu

The Calculation management summary tab contains information tabs showing the Calculation summary, as shown in the CMM calculation sheet in Figure 44.

## 13.2	CMM summary tab

The CMM summary tab lists all the inputs required for the CMM calculation. Users can track their CMM calculations by CMM group or function name or by id, as shown in Figure 20.  Table 37 outlines the fields used in the CMM input summary tab.

## 13.3	CMM input summary operation

Users can add, edit, and remove project calculation details in the CMM input calculator sheet. Users can also copy and paste data from the popup panel. There is a refresh function to refresh the CMM calculator data.  To access the menu list right click on the CMM calculator sheet, which displays the dropdown menu.


## 13.3.1	Creating a new CMM summary tab

STEM allows users to create a new calculation record in the CMM tab for developing models. A new record is created by selecting the ‘Add CMM’ button in the CMM summary sheet, see Table 36. This will open the CMM settings popup form, as shown in figure below. Basic calculation information, including function name, calculation file, MPG type and template can be entered into the new CMM options page. Once filled the user clicks the ‘add button’ to insert a record into the CMM summary tab.  


Figure 79: Add CMM settings page


## 13.3.2	Editing an CMM summary 

To edit a calculation record in the CMM tab select the row in the CMM sheet then click the ‘Edit CMM button’ in the menu bar, see Table 36. The CMM settings popup form will be generated, as shown in Figure 79.

## 13.3.3	Remove an CMM record

To remove an CMM record from the CMM summary sheet select the row in the CMM and then click the ‘Remove’ CMM button in the menu bar, see Table 36. A warning message will appear when you perform this operation. Select ‘Yes’ to perform operation or ‘No’ to stop the deletion, shown below.



! Note.

Warning: This operation will delete not only the record but also the functions and components associated with the CMM. A warning message will appear when you perform this operation. The data deleted cannot be recovered!



## 13.3.4	Refresh a CMM record

To refresh a CMM record from the CMM summary sheet select the row in the CMM and then click the ‘Refresh’ button in the menu bar, see Table 36. 

## 13.3.5	CMM Usage

The usage button enables users to view the location of the calculation data. To view the CMM usage records in the CMM summary sheet click the ‘Usage’ button in the menu bar, see Table 36. In this example, the CMM record are being used in three FMEA calculations and a FTA calculation respectively. Each calculation is referenced by the CMM Id and description.

## 13.3.6	View CMM details

To view the CMM sheet, click the View Details button on the right side of the summary sheet. This opens the CMM calculator, which is in the CMM calculator tab, where the user can build the CMM models see Figure 81. 

The functions of the vertical button used to view the CMM worksheet is shown in Table 38.

• Tip 
The worksheet columns can be adjusted by dragging the edge of the header.


## 13.4	CMM Calculator 

The CMM calculator tab allows users to build functions and components related to the systems and subsystems defined from the input sheet MPG and component elements. The features of the CMM worksheet are shown in Figure 81. 
Further details of the functions and components for both methods are described in Table 39.

## 13.5	CMM calculator operations 

Users can Add, Edit, delete and save functions or components in the CMM Calculator by right clicking the row. Users can also copy and paste data from one CMM or from a text file. Users can also copy and paste data from the CMM file to other text editors or the reverse. The refresh function allows the user to refresh the CMM data. Users can access the menu list by right clicking on the CMM calculator sheet.

## 13.6	Add function

To add a new component to the CMM worksheet:
•	Select the cell or row on the CMM worksheet and right click to open the menu list.  The component from the list of systems and main product group 
•	Click on the add button to include the selection to the CMM input sheet.
The panel enables users to amend any row of data on the CMM worksheet. The failure identification and failure effects which defined by the user are presented in Table 7. Table 8 describes detection measures.



• Tip 
A description of the column heading’s can be found when the user hovers the cursor over the headings in the CMM table.

## 13.7	Add subfunction

To add a new subcomponent to the CMM worksheet:
•	Select the cell or row on the CMM worksheet and right click to open the menu list.  The component from the list of systems and main product group 
•	Click on the add button to include the selection to the CMM input sheet.
The panel enables users to amend any row of data on the CMM worksheet. Figure 81 below presents the subcomponents page. See Table 39 for a description of the features.

## 13.7.1	Copy and paste data

Users can select the cell in the CMM worksheet by clicking on it and holding down the left mouse button.  To obtain specific information on the Software, click on Edit, on the File menu bar and select Copy from the pull-down menu. Alternatively, select Ctrl – C on the keyboard to copy the object. 

Selected objects can be pasted within the worksheet by selecting Ctrl – P on the keyboard to paste the object.

## 13.7.2	Edit a single row of data

To edit a row on the FMEA worksheet:
•	Selected the cell or row on the FMEA worksheet and right click to open the menu list and select the edit selected row from the list of systems and main product group, see Figure 25.

You will get a Popup to edit the information.  The following image show the FMEA add Popup based on the MIL standards.

The popup filled with previously entered information. You can edit the details and click save button to save the changes, see Figure 26.
